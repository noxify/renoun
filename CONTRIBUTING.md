## Debugging

You can enable internal debug logs to help diagnose issues while developing or testing renoun.

Set the `RENOUN_DEBUG` environment variable before running commands:

- Allowed values:
  - `true` or `1`: enable logging at the most verbose level
  - `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`: set a specific minimum level
  - `false` or `0`: logging disabled (default)

Examples:

```bash
# Most verbose logging
RENOUN_DEBUG=true pnpm dev

# Info and above
RENOUN_DEBUG=info pnpm dev

# CLI example
RENOUN_DEBUG=debug renoun next dev
```
