In development, the component uses a Suspense fallback to render immediately while asynchronous syntax highlighting and analysis load in the background. In production, it renders the fully-resolved code block directly.

## MDX Inline Code

When using MDX with the `rehypePlugins` from `renoun/mdx` you can prefix the inline code with a language similar to fenced code blocks. For example:

```mdx
When using inline code `js console.log('Hello, World!')`, you can specify the language for syntax highlighting.
```
