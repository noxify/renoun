    'The renoun toolkit enhances the Next.js framework with powerful content and documentation features.',
  tags: ['next', 'next.js', 'framework'],
}

The renoun toolkit provides [collections](/collections), [syntax highlighting](/components/code-block), and [api references](/components/api-reference), making it easier to create accurate and engaging content for blogs, documentation, and design systems powered by Next.js.

## Install

To use renoun with Next.js, start with an existing or new Next.js project. If you don't have a project yet, you can create one using the Next.js create command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

## Setup

Modify the `next` scripts located in the project's `package.json` file to use the `renoun` CLI. This will ensure that the renoun process starts before your Next.js server:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "renoun next dev",
    "build": "renoun next build"
  }
}
```

<Note>

This command is necessary to enable renoun features in your Next.js project.
The `renoun` CLI starts a WebSocket server that communicates with components
and utilities in your project to provide accurate and performant code analysis and syntax highlighting.

</Note>

## MDX (Optional)

To enable writing MDX content in your Next.js application, we will use the [`@next/mdx`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/next-mdx) package. This package allows you to author MDX content in your Next.js project. Additionally, you can use the pre-configured `remarkPlugins` and `rehypePlugins` from `renoun/mdx`.

<Note>

This step is optional and only necessary if you plan to use MDX in your
project. Additionaly, you can skip adding the `renoun/mdx` package if you
want to configure your own MDX plugins.

</Note>

First, install the Next.js MDX plugin:

<PackageInstall packages={['@next/mdx']} />

Now, add the plugin to your `next.config` file while optionally including the pre-configured `remarkPlugins` and `rehypePlugins` from `renoun/mdx`:

```js
import createMDXPlugin from '@next/mdx'
import { remarkPlugins, rehypePlugins } from 'renoun/mdx'

const withMDX = createMDXPlugin({
  extension: /\.mdx?$/,
  options: {
    remarkPlugins,
    rehypePlugins,
  },
})

export default withMDX({
  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'ts', 'tsx', 'md', 'mdx'],
})
```

## MDX Code Blocks

Use the `MDXComponents` export to override the `pre` and `code` components in your project's `mdx-components.tsx` file:

```tsx filename="02.mdx-components.tsx"
import { MDXComponents } from 'renoun/components'

export function useMDXComponents() {
  return MDXComponents
}
```

This forwards the meta information added from the `@renoun/mdx` rehype plugin to the `CodeBlock` component.

## Creating Collections

The `Collection` utility is a core concept in renoun. This allows you to query a collection of files from the file system. For example, to create a list of blog posts or documentation pages we can query all the MDX files in a directory:

```tsx
import { Collection } from 'renoun/collections'

const posts = new Collection({
  filePattern: 'posts/*.mdx',
})
```

<Note>

When creating a new collection for the first time, a dynamic import will be
generated at the collection's call site for each targeted extension during the development and build
process. These imports are necessary to load the targeted files from
the file system.

```ts highlightedLines="5"
import { Collection } from 'renoun/collections'

const posts = new Collection(
  { filePattern: 'posts/*.mdx' },
  (slug) => import(`./posts/${slug}.mdx`)
)
```

</Note>

We can then constrain the collection by providing types for the exports we're interested in querying:

```tsx
import { Collection } from 'renoun/collections'
import type { MDXContent } from 'renoun/mdx'

const posts = new Collection<{
  default: MDXContent
}>({
  filePattern: 'posts/*.mdx',
})
```

<Note>

`MDXContent` is a type exported from `renoun/mdx` that represents the default export of an MDX file. This type is used to ensure that the default export of each MDX file in the collection is an MDX component.

</Note>

Finally, we can use this collection to render the contents of our MDX files:

```tsx
import { Collection } from 'renoun/collections'
import type { MDXContent } from 'renoun/mdx'

const posts = new Collection<{
  default: MDXContent
}>({
  filePattern: 'posts/*.mdx',
})

export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>
}) {
  const post = await posts.getSource((await params).slug)

  if (!post) {
    return <div>Post not found</div>
  }

  const Content = await post.getExport('default').getValue()

  return <Content />
}
```

This will create a collection of all MDX files in the `posts` directory and render them based on the provided slug.

### Generating Links

A source's `getPath` method is used to generate a URL path for each source in the collection. For example, to generate a link to each post, you can map over the collection using `getSources` and use the `getPath` method on a source to generate a list of links:

```tsx
import { Collection } from 'renoun/collections'
import type { MDXContent } from 'renoun/mdx'
import Link from 'next/link'

const posts = new Collection<{
  default: MDXContent
}>({
  filePattern: 'posts/*.mdx',
})

export default async function Page() {
  const allPosts = await posts.getSources({ depth: 1 })

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Blog</h1>
      <ul>
        {allPosts.map(async (post) => {
          const path = post.getPath()

          return (
            <li key={path}>
              <Link href={path}>{post.getTitle()}</Link>
            </li>
          )
        })}
      </ul>
    </>
  )
}
```

Collections are not limited to MDX files and can be used with _any file type_.

## Start

Now you can start your Next.js server with renoun enabled:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Congratulations, you've successfully set up renoun with Next.js! You can now create [collections](/collections) or use one of the many [components](/components) available to enhance your content and documentation.
